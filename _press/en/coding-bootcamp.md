# PT X Launches Free Coding Bootcamp for Underserved Youth

**Bangkok, Thailand – August 15, 2024** – As part of its commitment to social responsibility, PT X has launched a free coding bootcamp designed to provide high-quality programming education to underserved youth.

The inaugural cohort consists of 100 students from underrepresented communities who will undergo an intensive 12-week program covering web development fundamentals, JavaScript, and React.

"We believe that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not," said the Head of People at PT X. "Through this bootcamp, we hope to open doors for young people who might otherwise not have access to a career in technology."
